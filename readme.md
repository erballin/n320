# N320 Intermediate Media Application Development

See this project live onRender [here](https://n320.onrender.com/)

This is my N320 repo, hosting all of my submitted classwork and in-class demonstrations.

Each week will have it's own readme file containing information about that assignment along with a weekly recap of classwork.
